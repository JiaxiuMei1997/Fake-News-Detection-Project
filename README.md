# Fake-News-Detection
—Fake news detection is a serious concern in today’s world, as social media platforms allow us to consume news much faster and with less restricted editing, at an incredible rate and scale. The objective of this study is to use natural language processing (NLP) methodologies for text processing and train traditional machine learning and deep learning models to detect fake news based on news content. We propose a system that detects both binary and multi-class classifiers using classification techniques such as SVM, Random Forest, RNN, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. Additionally, we implement advanced pre-trained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, and compare their performance from different aspects. We test the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a benchmark LIAR dataset. Our results show that the XGBoost model outperforms all others, achieving an accuracy of 78%.
